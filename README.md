An archive of the projects I have made during my tenure in Lasalle.

Hello, I am Zeek.

People have been telling me to share, with a degree intimidation, my Processing code to Github. I didn't--because I did not know how to use Github. Please no laughing.

After months of familiarising myself with the service, plus, using simiilar cloud sharing services, I have finally pulled through.. 3 years later.

For best results, please load the .pde files with Processing 2.2.1.

That is all for now.

Yours sincerely,
Zeek
